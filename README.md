This plugin uses the Random method of Java to generate a number below one that is set in the config.yml file. For negatives, it subtracts the generated numbers from 0. It then checks 
the coordinates against a list of banned blocks and then if the block you are teleported to is not banned then it teleports you to this location. the permission is rtplugin.rtp
